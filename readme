setting up mongoDB

you can install monogoDB locally and use on your system or
visit https://account.mongodb.com create and log into your account

after you log in, create a cluster, select the shared version which is free unless
you have cash to splash...
select provider and region or you can leave it as default. give the cluster a name and
click on create

after cluster has been created, click on collections to create a database and click on
add own data. give the database a name and d collect a name. note that collect is
equivalent to tables in SQL database. while documents are equivalent to table rows in
SQL databases

after creating a collection, you need to create a user that can access the database from
our code. So click on database access under security, and click on add new database user
enter username and password and give read and write access to the user and click on create.

go back to database and click on connect, click on connectyour application and copy connection
string.

and it is better to use a package called mongoose to connect and interact with monogoDB

for schema... we make the schema, then we define a model based on that schema, and the model 
should be the singular of the collection in our database
